## Question 1

* Ask the user to enter two ints: a and b.
* Generate a multiplication table where the width is a and the height is b

__For Example__

if `a = 3, b = 4`

Table should look like:
```
1   2   3
2   4   6
3   6   9
4   8   12
```
Save this table to a file.

Use exception handling when applicable
use a function called `generate_multiplication_table(width, height)` to generate the table
Call this function when you need it
